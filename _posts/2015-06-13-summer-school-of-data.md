The Summer School of Data took place on June, 17-18 in Thessaloniki, Greece. The Summer School of Data was addressed to scientists, students, trainers, journalists and healthcare professionals. It was structured in two parallel programmes both referring to open knowledge.

As part of the event, a visualisation survey took place. More than 35 participants worked in groups to explore different ways of visualising budget data. The results can be viewed on the website of the [visualisation survey](http://vobs.okfn.gr/content/openbudgetseu-1st-visualization-survey)
