The kick-off meeting of the OpenBudgets.eu project happened in the 29th and 30th June, at the castle of Frauhofer Institute, in Sankt Augustin, Germany. Project partners from seven European countries were present to the first official meeting, where the main concepts were discussed and the consortium partners had a chance to meet one another in person. 

The OpenBudgets.eu aims to provide a generic framework and concrete tools for supporting financial transparency, thus enhancing accountability within public administrations and reducing the possibility of corruption. The idea is to offer municipalities easy-to-use tools were they can publish their financial data and interact with citizens, also supporting participatory budgeting mechanisms.
